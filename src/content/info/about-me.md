  title: About Me
---

My full name is **Hieu Nguyen Ho Trung** (vn: **Nguyễn Hồ Trung Hiếu**), and I'm currently a college student. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing everything from technology, programming, science, music, and more.

There's a quote that I really like:

> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.
>
> - Albert Einstein

I'm a firm believer that anyone can have a solid grasp on anything if they put their mind to it, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new things and improve myself.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam](https://hcmus.edu.vn/) (HCMUS). I enrolled in the [Vietnam-France](https://www.ctda.hcmus.edu.vn/vi/educational-program/chuong-trinh-viet-phap/) program, which is a joint program between HCMUS and [Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, France](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/). I'm in my 3rd year at the moment and I'm expected to graduate in 2024.

I can't say that I'm an excellent student but definitely a dedicated one. I do enjoy learning new things and have had the opportunities to meet and work with many savvy tech geeks at this place. I also got to participate in many interesting projects, events and competitions, which I'm very grateful for.

## Work Experience

In late 2021, I worked on a freelance project for a small personal diner. It was an Android application that allows customers to order food and drinks online. I worked with a team of 4 other developers to build the app from scratch. It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it.

Following that, I participated in the [Pencil Philosophy Coding Contest](https://triethocbutchi.com/), which was a 3-month long coding contest for students in Vietnam. I worked with other team members to build a Shopee-like product management/ordering application for a small business. It was fun!

At the moment I'm an intern at [DevSamurai](https://devsamurai.vn/), a software development consulting firm. I'm working on a Jira Confluence add-on that allows users to create polls. My work mainly involves refactoring and adding new features to the add-on, sometimes I work on the backend as well.

## Hobbies

I play guitar and I'm a big fan of [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/@Mautaus), and this [band](https://www.youtube.com/@Polyphia)
