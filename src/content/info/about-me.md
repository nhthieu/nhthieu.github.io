  title: About Me
---

My full name is **Hieu Nguyen Ho Trung**, but feel free to call me **Hieu**, or **Hiu** (like my friends do), or **Tom** (got the name from [this movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_Days_of_Summer)). I'm currently a college student, driven by my passion for programming, technology and a deep curiosity about the ever-evolving world of science. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing everything from technology, programming, science, music, and more.

There's a quote that I really like:

> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.

> - Albert Einstein

I'm *that guy* who is always eager to explore new things and always tinkering with ideas and making stuff. I'm a firm believer that anyone can have a solid grasp on anything if they put their mind to it, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new things and improve myself.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my dual Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at [Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam](https://hcmus.edu.vn/) (HCMUS). I enrolled in the [Vietnam-France](https://www.ctda.hcmus.edu.vn/vi/educational-program/chuong-trinh-viet-phap/) program, which is a joint program between HCMUS and [Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, France](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/), mainly because I love the French language (although I'm not very good at it). I'm currently in my 3rd year of study and I'm expected to graduate in 2024.

I can't say that I'm an excellent student but definitely a dedicated one. I do enjoy learning new things and got the opportunities to meet and work with many talented people at this place. I also got to participate in many interesting projects, events and competitions, which I'm very grateful for.

## Hobbies

Outside of programming, I play guitar, and I also enjoy listening to music, especially rock and math rock. I also enjoy reading books, watching movies, and playing video games in my free time.

## Contact with me

I don't actively use social media, but I'm most responsive via [email](mailto:nguyenhotrunghieu0106@gmail.com). I also have a [Github account](https://github.com/nhthieu) and a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhthieu16/).
