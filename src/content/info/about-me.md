  title: About Me
---

My full name is **Hieu Nguyen Ho Trung** (vn: **Nguyễn Hồ Trung Hiếu**), and I'm developer from Ho Chi Minh City. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing everything from technology, programming, science, music, and more.

There's a quote that I really like:

> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.
>
> - Albert Einstein

I'm a firm believer that anyone can have a solid grasp on anything if they put their mind to it, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new things and improve myself.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam (HCMUS)](https://hcmus.edu.vn/) . I'm in my last year at the moment and I'm expected to graduate in 2024.

I can't say that I'm an excellent student but definitely a dedicated one. I do enjoy learning new things and have had the opportunities to meet and work with many savvy tech geeks at this place. I also got to participate in many interesting projects, events and competitions, which I'm very grateful for.

## Work Experience

In late 2021, I worked with a team of 4 developers on a freelance project for a small personal diner in town. It was an Android application that allows customers to order food and drinks online. It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it.

Following that, I participated in a 3-month coding contest for students in Vietnam. I worked with other team members to build a Shopee-like product management/ordering application for a small business. It was fun!

At the moment, I'm an intern at [DevSamurai Vietnam](https://devsamurai.vn/), a software development consulting firm. I'm working on Jira and Confluence add-ons (plugins). My work mainly involves refactoring and adding new features to the add-ons, sometimes I work on the backend as well.

## Hobbies

I play guitar and I'm a big fan of [Mateus Asato](https://www.youtube.com/@Mautaus) and [Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/@Polyphia).
