## My contributions

This is the project that I'm working on for the internship at [DevSamurai Vietnam](https://devsamurai.vn/). I work both on the frontend and the backend of the app. My main responsibility includes:

- **Adding new features**: Add new features to the app based on the requirements from the product manager. Sometimes I like to roll out new features that I think would be useful for the app.
- **Optimizing the performance of the app**: Refactor and fix existing code to improve the performance of the app.
