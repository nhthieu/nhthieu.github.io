Hi, this is my personal website to showcase my profile and my projects. I sometimes write tech and non-tech related blogs on the website too.

I did write a [blog post](/blog/tech-stack) about the technical details of the website, so feel free to check it out.

**Some of the features include:**

- Built with Astro and Preact
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] To come: blog comments, i18n, gallery section
