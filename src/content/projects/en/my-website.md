Hi, this is my personal website to showcase my profile and my projects. I sometimes write tech and non-tech related blogs on the website too.

I did write a [blog post](/blog/tech-stack) about the technical details of the website, feel free to check it out.

## Tech stack

- Astro
- Preact
- Tailwind

## TODO

- [x] i18n support
- [ ] Add BaaS support (Firebase or Pocketbase) for blog comments
- [ ] Gallery section
