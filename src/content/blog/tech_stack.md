## Next.js

Having built websites with [React.js](https://react.dev/) before, I was already familiar with the basics of the library. However, there is just something missing from React.js that makes it "not quite there yet" for me. One of the things that I don't like about React.js is that it doesn't have a built-in routing system. I know that there are libraries out there that can help with this, but I just don't like the idea of having to rely on third-party libraries for something as fundamental as routing. And so, I decided to experiment with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a framework built on top of React.js. Next.js is a very powerful framework that comes with a lot of features out of the box, including a built-in routing system, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and many more. It has saved me a ton of time and effort and well, I'm just in love with this framework and I'm definitely going to use it for my future projects.

## Tailwind CSS

I remember the time when I first used vanilla CSS in my projects and let me tell you, it was such a horrible experience. Having to think of the class names, spending hours just to "center a div", oh and responsiveness! To be honest, I spent the majority of my time trying to tackle these mundane tasks rather than focusing on the actual logic and content of the website.

The moment I decided to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I knew that I would never go back to vanilla CSS ever again. Just like its name, it makes your coding experience fast like a wind. Although it does take some time to get the hang of it at first and a long class name in exchange, but it's definitely worth it.

## TypeScript

JavaScript has been my go-to language for the past few months. I love how flexible it is and how easy it is to get started. However, the lack of static typing can be a pain sometimes. I've had my fair share of bugs that could have been avoided if I had used a statically typed language. One of my friends recommended me to give [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) a try, and well I'm glad that I did. No more `undefined is not a function` errors, no more `Cannot read property 'x' of undefined` errors, and no more `Property 'x' does not exist on type 'y'` errors. It's just solid.

## Why I built this website

I've been wanting to build a personal website for a while now. I've had a few attempts in the past, though they were all short-lived and eventually taken down. I think the main reason for this was that I really didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do with it. I tried to design the website around a particular theme, but I would always get bored of it after a while, and it actually slowed down the whole process (FYI, I'm no designer, and to be honest the design of this website is still a work in progress and it doesn't look that great :v).

This website was supposed to be a side project to put in my resume, in order to develop my skillset and enhance my knowledge, plus I'm pretty free at the time of building the website. However, I decided to take it more seriously and actually put in the time to build and maintain it, and hopefully it will become something that I can be proud of.

## About the blog posts

I was on the fence about what to use for the blog posts. I was thinking about using a CMS (Content Management System) like [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), or [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). However, I decided to run my blogs on a low-tech solution. It has no CMS, but plain markdown files are parsed to HTML with a bit of restyling and uploaded to the server. I love the simplicity of markdown files and I think it's more than enough for my needs. Whenever I want to edit or write a new blog post, I just open up a new file and start writing. No need to login, no need to worry about the CMS going down or having updates, and no need to worry about my free-tier account going out of limits! I then push to my Github repository and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will automatically build and deploy the website for me.

## Some ending notes

I love writing, and I love sharing my knowledge with others. I want to write about things that I'm passionate about, things that I've learned, and things that I'm currently working on. I'm hoping that this website will be a place where I can share my knowledge and experience with others, and a place where I can look back and see how much I've grown as a developer.

## What's next?

I'm still a college student at the time of writing this, and I'm still learning new things every day. I will continue to improve the website and build more projects in the future. Also, I'm planning on adding some more features to the website like:

- [ ] Comment section: I'm still not sure about this one since it will require a lot of work to implement and maintain. I'm thinking about using some BaaS (Backend as a Service) for this.
- [ ] Multi-language support: I'm planning on adding Vietnamese support to the website since I'm Vietnamese and I want to share my knowledge with my fellow Vietnamese developers. In addition to that, I know French so I might add support for this language as well in the future. Not rooting for this one though, since I'm not sure if I will be able to maintain the translations. But anyway, fingers crossed!
- [ ] More blog posts: I'm planning on writing more blog posts in the future. I'm currently working on a few projects and I'm planning on writing about them. I'm also planning on writing about some of the things that I've learned and some of the things that I'm currently learning. So, stay tuned!
