*"Hello, friend"*? That's lame. Maybe I should give this blog post a proper name. But *"Hello, friend"*?, that's the second most popular two-word phrase literally every programmer says just behind *"Hello, world"* right? I mean, [he](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot) said it, and it stuck...

As I sit down and slowly type out these words, I can't help but feel a bit nervous, yet excited as I'm setting my first stepping-stones on this long journey ahead. I've never been good at writing, and I've never been good at expressing my thoughts. Sometimes I wanted to write down exactly how I felt, but somehow I just stared at the blank screen, and the paper stayed empty. It's humble beginnings, I guess. That being said, I'm still going to give it a try. I feel like I have a lot more to write about right now, and have been blessed with a plethora of experiences and new and interesting friendships compared to the past.

I'm guiding this website towards a more personal direction. I want it to be a place where I can showcase my profile as well as a place where I can write about things that I'm passionate about, things that I've learned, and things that I'm currently working on. I'm hoping that this will be a place where I can share my knowledge and experience with others, and a place where I can look back and see how much I've grown as a developer. Also, I will be writing in English for the most part, it's not my native language but I think it's a good way to practice my writing skills and my proficiency in the language.

Nothing is set in stone yet and I'm still experimenting with different ideas. But there's one thing for sure, it's that I'm excited to see where this journey will take me.

Don't know how to end this blog post so I'm just gonna put a quote from [one of my favorite shows ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman) here:

> It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part. But it does get easier.
