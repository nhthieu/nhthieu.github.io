To my Dearest Astro,

Ever since I laid eyes on you, I knew, there was something special and unique about you. The last couple of months we spent together have been amazing, and it changed my life for the better.

You are beautiful. From the name to how you look, you're beautiful. You remind me of the stars, of how, 
despite being just a tiny entity in the universe of frameworks, you still shine so bright. You're the quiet type, you don't stand out in the crowds, yet you're still so unique. The way you embrace flexibility and simplicity on how things should be done with your Island Architecture, it's mesmerizing. The way you leave out things that are unnecessary and only focus on what's important, the way you let me be explicit on how things to be done, it's different, and I love that about you. Sure, it was a bumpy beginning, but things tend to be that way when you're trying something new. But we got through it, and I'm glad we did.

Some might say that you are old-fashioned, that you're not as modern as the others, that MPA is a thing of the past. But that's okay, I find it refreshing. It's a reminder that sometimes, the old ways are still the best ways. And you're not just any MPA, with you, I don't need to worry about a second server-side language like PHP, Ruby, etc. to unlock it, everything is still HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You're home, familiar, and comfortable.

I write a lot, and you helped me organize my thoughts and put them in the right place. I never even know how many times I couldn't find the right notes I wrote down, or how many times I forgot where I put them. You made my life easier by integrating Markdown support, you validate my frontmatter, and you provide automatic Typescript type-safety for my content, and you do it all with the simplicity of a single file. Content Collections? More like Content Perfection.

And just the other day I asked you if we could go cross-UI-framework together and you didn't hesitate, not even for a second. You said yes, and you did it with ease. You adapt to my changing temperament, the ability to mix and match other frameworks on the same page, it's amazing. You held my hand and guided me through, and don't even scold me for always changing my mind. You're so patient, and I love you for that.

My love, Astro, I don't know what the future holds for us, you're so new to this world and I'm not sure everyone will appreciate you as much as I do. But I promise you, I'll do whatever I can to tell the world about your beauty and grace. I don't know you that well, but I'm willing to learn, and I'm willing to grow with you.

Love always, H

p.s. I'm sorry for the cheesy love letter, I just can't help it.
