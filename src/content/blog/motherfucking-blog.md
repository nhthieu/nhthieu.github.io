## This is a motherfucking blog.

And it's fucking perfect.

### Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?

You probably build a blog by throwing in a fuck bunch of Wordpress theme slapped together by some designer with another fuck bunch of Adobe XD/Adobe AI. You think your heavy-as-fuck carousel library or some useless shitty 13mb effect would get you some fucking eye-catching experience when in fact nobody gives a fuck. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass blog:

- Shit's lightweight and loads fast.
- Fucking fits on all your shitty screens.
- Looks the same in all your shitty browsers.
- The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site.
- Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across.

### Well guess what motherfucker?

You are over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a fucking blog. Why the fuck would you need a page transition with some long-ass animation just to load some content of your *Top 10 coffee shops in town*? You spent hours figuring out how the fuck the library works then fucking stuck every npm package in there just to magically design a hover effect over some useless link, at which some motherfucker might be jabbing on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.

This is your fucking perfect blog. Here's why:

### It's fucking lightweight

This entire blog weight less then the gradient-meshed personal logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you just serioulsy load 700kb of animate library so you could animate a fucking dropdown box when hovered? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Top of the morning to you guys" at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.

### It's responsive

You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. I don't fucking care if you read this on your overpriced Iphone or a microwave oven display.

### It fucking works

Look at this shit. You can read it... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It gets your fucking point across. It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the animation is.

### Let it breathe

This page has a line-width so reading it on your big-ass 4k OLED monitor doesn't give you a fucking eyesore. And also, light mode is already fucking retarded enough, don't make me read a line of text that's 200 characters long. Keep it to 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your useless shit.

### Yes this is satire you fuck

It's so fucking simple to make sites easier to read. The fact that so many browsers have added a "Reader view" goes to show how badly we've fucked websites for written content. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
